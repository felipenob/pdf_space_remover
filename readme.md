# PDF Space Remover
What is this? A tool for removing unwanted and annoying spaces that usually come from PDF files when using the copy and paste commands.
There are two different scripts in the folder:
1. A basic Python script that runs in a terminal.
2. The same script that is adapted to run using Streamlit.
